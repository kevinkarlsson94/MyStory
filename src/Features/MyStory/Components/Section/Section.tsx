        <p>
          I was born in Ã–rebro in Sweden. My family lived in a small town called Kumla and when I was 2 years old we moved to the forest
          where I spend most of my childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spend most of my days here playing with sticks in the forest as very young, and later switched to playing with computers at an
          older age.
